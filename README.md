AndroidX Browser (Custom Tabs) — Borrow Chrome, Don’t Rebuild It

This project is a simple, modern demonstration of how to open web content inside your Android app using AndroidX Browser (Custom Tabs) — the same technology powering BrowserX in Android 15+.

Instead of embedding a WebView or relying on external Intents, Custom Tabs let your app borrow Chrome’s speed, security, and login sessions, while still keeping a native, branded experience.
